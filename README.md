### template for creation
* create project in VS
* Add Styles/*.scss
* npm init
* npm install grunt --save-dev
* npm install grunt-cli --save-dev
* npm install grunt-sass --save-dev
* add gruntfile.js to root with content provided
  * (these  can be installed globally by appending the command with '-g')
* add `const sass = require('node-sass'); && implementation: sass,`
* install Whack Whack Terminal (!)
